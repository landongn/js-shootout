1.3.7-1
------------------
- Laying groundwork for interoperability between `grunt-cli` and `grunt@0.3.x`.
- Kind of hackish, but requiring `grunt@<0.4.x` seems to play nice with both grunt versions.
- Node has changed up it's error reporting, so check-dependencies.js has been updated to account for both reports.
- Update Travis, remove unused globals.
- Update Statix plugin to play nice with 2.0.0 rewrite.
- Statix can now be run locally.
- Statix now only watches for template changes as well as its own config changes.
- When `red-start` is not installed, Statix substitutes `grunt server` for its own server watch task.
